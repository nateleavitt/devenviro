Here is a list of my dotfiles that I use for my local dev environment setup

## Installation ##
  * First, clone the repo
  * Then cd into the `dotfiles` folder and run `bootstrap`

Note that this will install Homebrew and RVM by default.  If you would like to skip this 
then run the same command with the following options
  * Don't install Homebrew `-h false`
  * Don't install RVM `-r false`
